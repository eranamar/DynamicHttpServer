Dynamic Http Server
==========================
This was Exercise NO.3 and NO.4 written during Internet Technologiest 
course at HUJI during winter 2014.

In this exercise my partner and I implemented a dymanic http server which 
compose of two main modules:
The first one in miniHttp.js and the second is miniExpress.js, both 
simplifies version of the known http node module and ExpressJS framework.

The propose of those exercises was to learn deeply the HTTP protocol, and 
implement a server which follow most of it. In addition, building from 
scratch a simple version of ExpressJS framework which enables adding dynamic 
functionality to that server (i.e parsing cookies, serving static files, 
URL parameters and more).
